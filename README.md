# navigation_Project

This project integrates existing ROS packages to build a complete robot navigation system in simulation. It uses simulation environments, robot models, and navigation logic to demonstrate a real-world inspired navigation stack.

## Project Structure

The following packages are part of this workspace:

- **`testbed_bringup`** ‚Äì Launch files and overall orchestration
- **`testbed_description`** ‚Äì Robot URDF and sensor setup
- **`testbed_gazebo`** ‚Äì Simulation world and plugins
- **`testbed_navigation`** ‚Äì Custom package developed for path planning, localization, and robot control

## üîç How It Works

The main logic and navigation setup are implemented in the custom package:  
 **[`testbed_navigation`](./testbed_navigation)**

This package links the other modules and brings everything together ‚Äî from robot spawning to executing navigation goals using ROS navigation stack components.

For detailed steps, features, and configurations, check the README inside `testbed_navigation`.
